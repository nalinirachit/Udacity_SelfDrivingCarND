Udacity Self Driving Car nanodegree
Self Driving Car Nano Degree
This repository contains my project submissions for Udacity's self-driving car nano degree.
The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, BMW and many others.

### Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision (Jan 2017 to May 2017)

•	Project 1 (Computer Vision): Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision): Introductory project which used basic computer vision techniques like canny edge and hough transforms to detect lane lines.

•	Project 2 (Deep Learning): Traffic Sign Classifier (Deep Learning) - Use tensorflow to train a convolution neural network capable of detecting road side traffic signs.

•	Project 3 (Deep Learning): Behavioral Cloning (Deep Learning): Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network.

•	Project 4 (Computer Vision): Advanced Lane Lines (Computer Vision): Use of image thresholding, warping and fitting lanes lines to develop a more robust method of detecting lane lines on a road

•	Project 5(Computer Vision):  Vehicle Detection (Computer Vision): Use of HOG and SVM to detect vehicles on a road

### Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control (May 2017 to August 2017)

•	Project 1 Extended Kalman Filters:  Use a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.

•	Project 2 Unscented Kalman Filters: Implement an unscented Kalman filter using the CTRV motion model.

•	Project 3 Kidnapped Vehicle: Localization project - Implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++.

•	Project 4 PID Controller: Implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around a track.

•	Project 5 Model Predictive Control: Implement Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track.
